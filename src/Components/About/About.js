                I'm Gaurav, the creative mind behind this text utility online tool. Currently pursuing my studies at the National Institute of Technology Meghalaya, I'm passionate about the intersection of creativity and coding. As a dedicated web developer, I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I've got a knack for making things come to life with React.js.<br /><br />Beyond the realm of coding, I also venture into the world of graphic design. So, not only can I transform text, but I can also give it a visually appealing touch.<br /><br />This project is a testament to my skills and the magic that happens when creativity and coding collide. With this text utility tool, users can effortlessly change the case of their content, copy text with ease, and much more. It's a manifestation of my commitment to making things not only functional but also user-friendly.<br /><br />Take a tour of my project, explore the functionalities, and witness firsthand how a mix of creativity and coding can elevate a simple text utility tool into something awesome. Let's make something incredible together â€“ because that's what happens when innovation meets passion!
